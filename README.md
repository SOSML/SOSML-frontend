Node.JS version 8 or higher and NPM version 5 or higher need to be installed on the system. A Unix like OS especially Linux is recommended. 
Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the root of the project directory.
If you want a built for deployment version just run `npm run build` and you can then find this version in the build folder.
For developing on this repo just run `npm run start` which lauches a version of the website in this repo and automatically updates if it detects changes in any project files.
